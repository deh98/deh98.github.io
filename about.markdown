I am passionate System engineer. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego, and am a certified Engineer-in-training(EIT).

This is a project to showcase my engineering project, personal experiences, and to have some fun with a personal website. 

If you are looking for a motivated, skilled engineer, please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
